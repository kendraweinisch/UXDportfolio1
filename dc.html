                                <p>Democracy Counts (DC) is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that found itself making a political statement it didn’t want to make. Its once-effective visuals now betrayed its message so the organization needed to rebrand its online presence.</p>

                                    <li><b>Unaware of their target users.</b> DC is an organization with an older board that had very little idea about who their website would attract. In 2020, its message began attracting users that were looking for highly politicized websites.</li>
                                    <li><b>Archaic website design.</b> DC’s website is aesthetically out of date and in need of modern copy.</li>
                                    <li><b>Lack of marketing knowledge.</b> The nonprofit has focused most of its efforts on printed collateral and word of mouth. These old forms of marketing can’t compete with martech in 2021.</li>
                                    <li><b>High bounce rate.</b> Due to the influx of politicized users to the website, the website had an extremely high bounce rate.</li>
                                    <li><b>Lack of responsiveness and accessibility.</b> Many of the visitors to the website were older and suffering from physical and cognitive declines that necessitated a website built for their use.</li>

                                    <li>Team of one. For this project, I was working alone as the sole researcher, designer, and writer.</li>
                                    <li>Budget and resource constraints. The nonprofit was limited by its budget. Consequently, I had to be creative with resources and tools.</li>

                            <div class="opacity-box">
                                <p>Even before usability interviews, I found the purple color scheme of the website confusing and incongruous with the theme of American elections. Additionally, the logos and apps didn’t have purple, which meant there was no cohesive brand identity.</p>
                                <p>During my initial analysis, I determined that the users were largely older than the board members knew. With many users being over the age of 70, I knew that accessibility and responsiveness must be front and center in my designs.</p>
                                <p>As I moved forward, I realized that I would need input internally and externally in this user-centered design approach to rebranding the website. First, I wrote and sent out a survey with Google Forms to the internal staff. Then, I sent out a survey to the contacts on their email newsletter list. These surveys would help me determine what users knew about DC, their feelings about it, and their activities with DC’s website. Additionally, the forms would highlight differences in perspectives between internal staff and newsletter contacts.</p>

                            <p>My digitized affinity diagram shows direct quotes from users as well as their desires. For example, one user wanted to start his own local election integrity group.</p>

                            <p>At this point, access to DC’s Google Analytics account provided insight on the organization’s website traffic, bounce rates, and users’ time on the landing page. All of these details were imperative in creating personas and journey maps because they helped me determine the problems users were facing as well as the issues the company had with branding. The Double Diamond Process allowed me to research and analyze before defining solutions. Using research, user feedback, and data analysis allowed me to design with the target user in mind, thus attracting the right users, getting them to interact with the site, and reinvigorating an organization.</p>

                            <p>I needed to determine how to modernize the copy on the website as well as increase usability by improving responsiveness and increasing accessibility for older users. I used various website checkers, like Semrush, to assess SEO, responsiveness, and overall marketability of the site.</p>
                            <p>I began to ideate the rebrand of the site by creating a mock-up in Sketch and crafting a prototype in Adobe XD. Next, I moved into usability testing remotely with users from the internal staff and external contact lists. During this process, I was able to determine that minor tweaks were needed for the content (more grouping for better clarity as well as attention to the UI in terms of color palette, font sizing, and visuals).</p>

                                        <li>Success: Content structure and layout is imperative to building engaging websites. Grouping content, editing copy, and creating a pull-down menu creates an easily navigable site that eases the cognitive load on users.</li>
                                        <li>Success: Build with accessibility in mind. With seniors as the target users, paying close attention to the responsiveness of the pages as well as how their content is displayed is imperative to prolonging user engagement.</li>
                                        <li>Lesson: UX design is its own job. After wearing multiple hats (researcher, writer, marketer, designer, and developer liaison), it would have been more effective to get more support on the projects that weren’t largely focused on design. Being spread thin amongst a host of roles made me realize how I could have improved efficiency and effectiveness.</li>
