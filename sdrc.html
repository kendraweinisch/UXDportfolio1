                                    <li>Engaging new markets. The consultancy is a premier choice amongst dive agencies in Southern California, but it didn’t know how to capture the attention of new markets online.</li>
                                    <li>Enticing the user. The founder was having trouble communicating her services and the scientific methods behind them without boring the user.</li>

                                    <li>Lack of users to interview. While gaining data and insight, I performed qualitative interviews in-person and remotely via Zoom with clients of the agency. However, due to the small market overall, the list of people available to take part in interviews within this slim timeframe was marginal.</li>
                                    <li>Deadline Limitations. The founder had a tight turnaround time of only two weeks before the developers were set to begin. Within that timeframe, I was tasked to collect and analyze data. Further, I led the conception of the brand identity and the design of the website.</li>
                                    <li>Limited by budget and resources. Not only was I working on a short deadline, but I was constrained by budget and resources. As the sole researcher and designer, I took on the brunt of the work.</li>

                                <p>After meeting with the founder of the company, I began researching. Much of my research came in the form of qualitative interviews as a preliminary step to understanding the community and what matters to it most when choosing a consultancy. After a few preliminary interviews to understand what existing customers knew of SDRC, I began to uncover what touchpoints the homepage would need to attract the right users and made a mind map.</p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <div class="margin-box colored">

                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <div class="opacity-box">
                            <p>Once personas were set (above), I started with hand-drawn sketches of the site to determine the information architecture as well as the wireframing for the next phase. I conscripted friends and family to walk me through a range of tasks on the paper wireframe while I watched silently.</p>
                            <p>Based on their feedback, my research, and my created personas, I began to work on the overall look and feel of the website in Sketch. The founder was adamant that the site be bright and cheerful with simple copy that international users could easily understand or translate with Google. For these reasons, I chose bright blues and complementary greens to communicate trust and sustainability. I used crisp, modern fonts to embolden short, simple sentences. I followed all the best practices then returned to my integrated user group of SCUBA enthusiasts and laypeople with the following mock-up:</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="margin-box colored">

                        </div>
                        <div class="opacity-box">
                            <p>Through Zoom, I remotely followed the users as they navigated the mock-up. In the first part of the interview, I asked the users to describe the website and how they felt about it. In the second part of the interview, I asked users to determine what the business did and provide other insights that should have been gleaned from the copy. The feedback was poor due to confusing imagery and wording.</p>
                            <p>As a result, we revisited the copy and imagery to better reflect the consultancy’s services and clarify its value proposition. In the second round of usability interviews, I A/B tested new users within and outside of the SCUBA and resort industry with the old mock-up and the new mock-up. The new mock-up with simple and direct copy that was supported by reflective imagery performed incredibly well amongst users.</p>

                            <p>Honing in on users was key to my success in designing this website for SDRC. Without my users, I would have continued with the poorly performing mock-up that pictured scuba equipment. Although aesthetically beautiful, the images confused users on what services were provided by SDRC. Understanding how users saw and interpreted the site saved a lot of money on development.</p>

                                        <li>Success: Using mock-ups during usability testing saves money on development. Once I had a successfully performing mock-up, I handed off the designs to the development team. Alternatively, going straight into the development process, then testing with users can be an exorbitant cost to small businesses like SDRC. </li>
                                        <li>Success: User-centered designs work. Getting input from users is key to unlocking messaging, desires, and behaviors of target personas. Effective websites will always look to users before development.</li>
                                        <li>Lesson: Function triumphs over art. Images chosen in the first prototype didn’t convey the agency’s message nor support the website copy.</li>
                                        <li>Lesson: Determining two personas is enough. In niche markets like the dive community, having fewer personas is normal and enough to determine common needs, behaviors, desires, and actions of the user.</li>
